"""
This tutorial is very similar to tutorial 3, as it concerns a weak imposition of
a Dirichlet boundary conditions through a Lagrange multiplier.
The main difference with respect to previous tutorials is in the mesh (and restrictions)
generation stage, available in the file data/generate_restrictions.py.
In this tutorial we use gmsh to generate a data/mesh.msh file starting from the geometry
described in data/mesh.geo, which represents a sphere embedded in a box.
Mesh and subdomain files, in xml format, can then be obtained
through the FEniCS script dolfin-convert. As dolfin-convert does not automatically provide
restrictions as output, two auxiliary methods are provided in data/generate_restrictions.py
to automatically generate subdomain restrictions and interface restrictions based on
subdomain ids. These restrictions are then employed in this script to solve a Poisson problem
on the sphere (with manufactured solution g), discarding degrees of freedom on its complement.
