r"""
In this example we solve a Laplace problem with non-homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions, imposed through a penalty method, i.e.
    (A + P) u = f + q
where A and f are associated to the discretization of the Laplace problem
with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, while the penalty matrix P
is defined as
    P_{ij} = penalty * \delta_{ij}, if i on boundary,
    P_{ij} = 0, if i in the interior,
and the penalty vector q as
    q_i = penalty * g(coordinate(i)), if i on boundary,
    q_i = 0, if i in the interior
being penalty a large number, g(x, y) the prescribed non-homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary condition, coordinate(i) the coordinate of the i-th
degree of freedom.

The preferred way to impose non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions should still
either be through BlockDirichletBC objects (see tutorial 1) or lagrange multipliers
(see tutorial 3). This example means to show how to get the list of degrees of freedom
associated to a specific restriction, and how to perform local modifications to assembled
matrices.
